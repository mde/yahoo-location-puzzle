General notes
- No server needed, just file-open the index.html
- Script-append code was something I had previously implemented, no need to use JQuery Ajax
- Generally avoided use of third-party libs for this simple app
- Responsive, should work at most screen sizes
- Tested in FF and Chrome desktop

To-Dos
- Tests! Starting with the input parsing and query formatting
- Package with Browserify or AMD, minify
- Pass Mustache as a param, no global
- Make work with browser history
- Don't display next page link when less than full page of results
- Pull template out into separate file
